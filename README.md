# Stereo Width Demo

A simple implementation of mid-side processing (see e.g. [this article](https://theproaudiofiles.com/mid-side-processing/)).

There are two simple controls:

* _Width_: controls the _stereo width_ of the signal. When set to hard left, the signal becomes mono. When set to centre the signal is unchanged and, finally, when set to right the signal becomes "fully stereo" i.e. there is no mono component left. 

* _Gain_: just sets the gain of the signal
